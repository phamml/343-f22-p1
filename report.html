  <h1>CS 343 Project 1 - Report</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>At least 5 separate pages: </strong> This expectation was met as my website contains 8 separate pages, including the index.html page. There is a home page, a recipes page that displays all the recipes, a blog page, an about page, a contact page, and 3 more pages one for each recipe.</li>
    <li><strong>Favicon: </strong>The website meets this expectation as there is a favicon of a salad bowl for each of the 8 pages</li>
    <li><strong>Include header: </strong>This expectation was met as there is a header section for each of the 8 pages</li>
    <li><strong>Include navagation links: There is a navbar at the top of each page that contains navagation links to all the pages of the website, so I believe this expectation is met.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries: </strong>I believe this expectation was met as media queries were utilized in the different css style sheets to customize the website layout for small and large screens. For example, for larger screens the website mainly displays divs in a row layout, however when the screen is minimized to a certain size the div layout changes to a column style. The navagation bar at the top of the website is also responsive and supports layouts for large and small screens.</li>
    <li><strong>Images: </strong>The website meets this expectation as there are several images incorporated throughout the website and each have alt attributes that adequately describes the image content.</li>
    <li><strong>Nu Validator/WAVE Accessibility: </strong>This expectation was met as the website validates wihtout any errors or warning using the Nu Validator and WAVE Evaluator</li>
    <li><strong>At least 2 different font faces: </strong> I believe this expectation was met because there were different fonts used for headings and the body. For instance, "Oswald" was primarily used for the headings at the top of each page, "Catamaran" was used for primarily used for subheadings and links, and "Ovo" was primarily used for the body.</li>
    <li><strong>Include at least one form: </strong>This expectation was fulfilled with the form located on the Contact page. It performs content verification making sure a valid name and email is given as well as ensures the user enters something in the message box.</li>
    <li><strong>Links to external sites: </strong>There are several links to different social media pages included in the website, so I believe this expectation was met.</li>
    <li><strong>Website available on github page: </strong>The website is published on github pages and fulfills this expectation.</li>
