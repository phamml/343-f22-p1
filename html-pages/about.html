        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <h2>HI, MY NAME IS &ensp; <span style="font-size: 4rem; font-family: Dawning of a New Day">Natalie</span></h2>
        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Natalie Nettemeyer. I am a Student-Athlete at James Madison University, majoring in Dietetics 
          and I anticipate graduating in the Spring of 2023. 
        </p>
        
        <p>My interest in nutrition started at a young age, but it wasn't until my path 
          began at JMU that I realized my dream career was to become a sports dietitian. Growing up playing soccer, basketball, and running 
          cross country, I was always fascinated with the idea that good nutrition can enhance athletic performance. I am very passionate 
          about health, sports, and wellness and would love to educate athletes on how they can improve their performance based on their dietary habits. 
          I believe the cornerstone of living a healthy lifestyle is based on both a physical and mental balance. I aspire to educate people 
          to become knowledgeable about food and nutrition and how to supply their bodies with the proper fuel to maximize their potential. 
          I want people to enjoy what they eat, to live a healthy lifestyle, and most importantly to be happy about themselves.
        </p>
