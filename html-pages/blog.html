    <p class="blog">
      Incorporating a healthy diet in my life has been a major goal for me in the past few years and is 
      something I would advise everyone to strive for in their life. Eating healthier has not only allowed me 
      to achieve a better physique, but has also allowed me to feel better too. When I was younger and eating 
      more processed foods I remember my stomach always feeling bloated and my body always feeling rundown by 
      late afternoon with no energy. Ever since I started eating more whole foods and less processed foods, I 
      have felt a lot more energized throughout the day, which has helped me be more productive when performing 
      my day-to-day tasks.

      Making the switch to a healther diet can seem daunting, however it doesn't necessarily need to be a drastic
      change. In fact, having a drastic change in your diet can actually be more harmful as you are less likely to 
      maintain your new lifestyle. It is better to start out making small changes and then building upon those changes
      once you feel you have maintained a steady routine. For example, instead of cutting out of eating sugar entirely,
      you can first start with eating foods that have reduced sugar and then maybe move on to only eating sugar once a day.
      Another thing to keep in mind is that you don't have to only eat salads and vegetables to be on a "healthy" diet.
      A healthy and nutritious meal often involves these three main food groups: protein, carbohydrates, and fruits
      and/or vegetables. Incorporating these three food groups into each of your meals will provide you with enough nutrients
      and energy to keep you energized throughout the day. If you only focus on eating salads there's no doubt you will find
      yourself hungry more quickly, which will lead to more snacking throughout the day. Transitioning to a healthier lifestyle 
      may also seem uneasy to some people because they feel they don't have the time to cook meals with how fast pace society 
      is nowadays. However, meal prepping can be a simple solution to this common fear. Meal prepping is the action of preparing 
      whole meals ahead of schedule. I usually like to meal on Sunday's when I am not as busy, and make enough meals that usually
      last me until Thursday or Friday. This allows me to save so much time during the week when my schedule gets pretty hectic as 
      all I have to do is heat up my food in the microwave. I can also take my meals to go if need. Another beneficial thing about
      meal prepping is that it prevents you from overindulging in your meals, since the portion sizes are predetermined. Some easy
      meal prepping ideas that I like to make that would be good for beginners is a meal that includes oven baked chicken, rice, and 
      vegetables or a meal that includes salmon, salad, and roasted potatoes. Each of these meals are well balanced and includes protein,
      carbohydrates, and vegetables. Eating healthy meals like these allows me to provide my body with the nutrients it needs to feel 
      fully maximized throughout the day. It can also have a beneficial impact on your mood, self confidence, and ability to think cleary too.
      There's no doubt that eating healthy can require some time and effort, but with the right mindset and attitude, you can achieve
      a healthir lifestyle in no time and is well worth all the doubts because you are providing your body with the fuel and energy
      it needs. When you eat healthy you are able to maximize your potential and be happy about yourself, allowing you to feel good both
      physically and mentally.
